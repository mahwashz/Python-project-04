# 📁 Bulk File Renamer

A simple Python script to rename all files in a folder with sequential numbering.


## 🛠️ What It Does
- Renames all files in a folder with a custom prefix
- Adds automatic numbering (1, 2, 3...)
- Preserves original file extensions (.jpg, .png, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Edit the script**:
   ```python
   folder = "C:/Users/YourName/Pictures"  # ← Change to your folder path
   prefix = "vacation"                   # ← Change to your desired prefix
Run the script:

bash
Copy
python rename_files.py
📝 Example
Before:

Copy
IMG_1234.jpg
DSC_5678.png
Screenshot.png
After (with prefix="trip"):

Copy
trip_1.jpg
trip_2.png
trip_3.png
⚠️ Important Notes
Works with ALL file types (images, documents, etc.)

Creates permanent changes - backup files first!

Will overwrite files if names conflict

💡 Customization Options
Start numbering from a different number:

python
Copy
# Change i+1 to i+10 to start from 10
new_name = f"{prefix}_{i+10}{ext}"
Add date to filenames:

python
Copy
from datetime import datetime
date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y%m%d")
new_name = f"{date}_{prefix}_{i+1}{ext}"
❓ FAQ
Q: Can I undo the renaming?
A: The script doesn't create backups. You'll need to manually rename files back.

Q: Does it work with subfolders?
A: No, it only processes files in the specified folder.
