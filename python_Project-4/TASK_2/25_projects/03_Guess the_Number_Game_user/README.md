🎮 Guess the Number Game
This project is a fun and interactive number guessing game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 10. It helps beginners practice Python loops, conditional statements, input handling, and logic building.

🕹️ How It Works
1️⃣ The program selects a random number between 1 and 10.
2️⃣ The user enters a guess.
3️⃣ The game provides feedback:

If the guess is too high, it asks the user to guess lower.
If the guess is too low, it asks the user to guess higher.
If the guess is correct, the game congratulates the player.
4️⃣ The user is shown all hints provided during the game.
5️⃣ The user can play again or exit the game.

🎮 Guess the Number Game
========================
Try to guess the secret number between 1 and 10!

Enter your guess (1-10): 5
💡 Hint: The secret number is higher.

Enter your guess (1-10): 8
💡 Hint: The secret number is lower.

Enter your guess (1-10): 7
🎉 Congratulations! You guessed the number **7** in 3 attempts!

💡 All Hints:
💡 Hint: The secret number is higher.
💡 Hint: The secret number is lower.

Do you want to play again? (yes/no): no
Thanks for playing! 🎮
🛠️ Concepts Practiced
✅ Loops (while loop) – The game runs until the correct guess is made.
✅ Conditional Statements (if-else) – Checks if the guess is higher, lower, or correct.
✅ Random Number Generation (random.randint()) – Generates a new number each time.
✅ User Input Handling (input()) – Ensures valid user input.
✅ String Formatting (f-strings) – Displays hints and results nicely.
✅ Hint Tracking (list) – Stores and shows hints at the end of the game.
✅ Replay Mechanism (recursion) – Allows the player to play again without restarting the program.

🚀 How to Run the Game
1️⃣ Make sure you have Python installed.
2️⃣ Copy the code and save it as guess_game.py.
3️⃣ Open Command Prompt (Windows) / Terminal (Mac/Linux).
4️⃣ Run the game with:

sh
Copy
Edit
python guess_game.py
5️⃣ Start guessing and have fun! 🎯
