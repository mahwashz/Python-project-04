Snake Game in Python
Welcome to the Snake Game project! This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's pygame library. The goal is to control a snake that grows longer as it eats food, while avoiding collisions with walls and itself.

Features
Classic Gameplay : Control the snake using arrow keys (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT).
Score Tracking : Your score increases each time you eat food.
Dynamic Difficulty : The game gets progressively harder as the snake grows.
Cross-Platform : Runs on any system with Python installed.
Installation
Install Python 3.x from here .
Install pygame:
bash
Copy
1
pip install pygame
Clone or download the repository.
Usage
Run the game using:

bash
Copy
1
python app.py
Use arrow keys to move the snake.
Eat red food blocks to grow the snake and increase your score.
Avoid hitting the walls or yourself.
How It Works
The snake moves in a straight line until you change its direction.
Eating food increases the snake's length and score.
The game ends if the snake hits the wall or collides with itself.
Extending the Project
Add levels or power-ups.
Save high scores to a file.
Create multiplayer mode or custom themes.
