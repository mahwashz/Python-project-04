🔄 Number Doubling Program
A simple Python script that continuously doubles a number until it reaches or exceeds 100.

⚙️ How It Works
1️⃣ The program prompts the user:

sh
Copy
Edit
Enter a number:
2️⃣ The user inputs a starting number.
3️⃣ The program repeatedly doubles the number and prints each step until it is 100 or greater.

🖥️ Example Output
🎯 User enters 10
sh
Copy
Edit
Enter a number: 10
20 40 80 160
🎯 User enters 50
sh
Copy

100
